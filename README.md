# Boredom Crusher

## Abstract

Boredom Crusher is a website that will provide you with randomly generated activities to perform when you're stuck at a loss. You can create a account, log in, or just view activities as a guest. Signing up and logging in allows you the ability to save activities and see them whenever you return to the site.
